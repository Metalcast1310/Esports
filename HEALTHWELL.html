		<p>Slime ranchers - Slime ranchers is a calm open world game where it allows you to capture and contain little cute looking slime blobs and some are friendly, others are not. This helps me relax because it looks so peaceful
			<br>
			<br>
Minecraft - Minecraft is a peaceful survivor game where you can do whatever you want/can to survive. This helps me relax because the relaxing music and the amount of things you can do  is calming.
			<br>
			<br>
Steven Universe: Save the Light/Unleash the Light - This game is an RPG turned-based game and this helps me relax because the music is so relaxing and you could just listen to it for hours
			<br>
			<br>
Any kind of rhythm game - Rhythm games are one the best relaxing games for me because it doesn't require anything, just your fast reflexes </p>
		
	  <h1>Negative affects for gaming?</h1>
	  <p>I disagree with this article because it says when children or young people play violent games, they become violent which is rather false because I used to play violent games all the time like GTA San Andres when I was around 6 years old and I am still positive and empathetic. <br>
		  <br>
		  There can be negative effects to gaming but it depends on the kind of games and how long you play it.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>This article is somewhat convincing because it makes some strong points and there are some methods to lessen the "violent thoughts" like setting a time limit to a certain game, or just don't let the kids play  it

      <p>First of all, eating is an important part of gaming but it's important to eat healthy. Eating healthy contains fruits, vegetables, grains, and etc. You should also, eat depending on your height and weight.</p>

      <p>Being active is a good thing to do when being a gamer. Any type of person physically can make you feel better physically and mentally. A typical good workout would be like 2 cardio days, 3 workout days, and 2 resting days
