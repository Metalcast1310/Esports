      <h3>What is Overwatch 2?</h3>
      <p>Over-watch is a 5v5 PvP game that is owned by blizzard. There 3 roles, Tanks, Dps, and Supports. Each team has 1 tank, 2 dps, and 2 supports. Each role is essential to a team fight because if your tank dies, commonly you will die too and that goes the same for supports and sometimes dps. To play this game you need to chose one these roles and to get better at the game you need to keep playing and practice each character in the practice range. Overwatch has a rating of 10/10 on IGN, has an audience rating of 3.7/5, and a 4/5 on Common Sense Media. This game is for 13 years old and up too. This page is for mid-level gamers and this can be helpful because it will explain good strategies and tactics.
</p>
      <p>There are tutorials to learn how to play the game and the only way to get better is to keep playing the game and there are in-game tip and tricks to look for. There are specific strategies to play the game and the game is somewhat easy to pick up due to how straight forward the game is.
There are many tactics and special teams comps, but you mostly have to communicate with your team and communication is a big part of this game. You also have to always adapt to the enemies team play style and pick counters (usually). This is pretty easy to pick up, but hard to master.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Things to do</h3>
      <p><strong>Communication is key:</strong> Always communicate to your team what is happening and what's going on. You could save your teammates doing this.
		  <br>
		  <strong>Use your ultimate at a good time:</strong> Some ultimates require good timing. Don't just randomly use your ults
		  <br>
		  <strong>Try to get easy kills:</strong> Some characters are more supportive than offensive. If one the enemy teammates is alone and not with their, while not being too far from your own team, you can try to go for the kill.
		  <br>
		  <strong>If your supports are not available, find health packs around the map:</strong> You can't always rely on your supports to heal you. There are health packs around the map that gives you a decent amount of health
		  <br>
		  <strong>Have a good team comp:</strong> There are certain characters that work well with each other and their ults would work well too
<br>ex- Zarya, Tracer, Hanzo, Lucio, Ana
		  <br>
		  <strong>Know when to use your abilities:</strong> Every ability has a cooldown and some of them can be really helpful in some situations.
		  <br>
		  Ex-Using zenyattas ultimate during the enemies Zarya's ultimate
		  <br>
		  <strong>Know who to ult:</strong> Certain ultimates can only kill one at a time. Going for the supports is always a good choice because supports are usually easiest to kill
		  <br>
		  <hr>
		<h3>Things NOT to do</h3>
	  <p><strong>DO NOT fight alone:</strong>  Never try to 1v5 a team because usually you would die. If you're the last one alive, you can either group up with your team or try to keep your distance and shoot from a far, trying to get ult charge
			<br>
		  <strong>Don't blame your supports:</strong> It's usually not there fault. Don't run away from your supports/healers if you need to heal up. Run towards them because they're most likely in need of help or healing other teammates.
		  <br>
		  <strong>Don't flank the enemy team (usually):</strong>  It's not always a good idea to flank the enemy team. Yes you will kill their back line, but your team will most likely need your help with front-line
		  <br>
		  <strong>Don't be a "one-trick-pony":</strong> Having a main and sticking to it is really good but sometimes that character isn't good for certain team comp. You should know when to switch off a character and know who counters who.
		  <br>
		  <br>
Ex- Your main is D.va but their team has a Zarya, switch
