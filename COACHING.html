   <h1>What to do:</h1>
	  <p><strong>Spread apart from your team in turf wars</strong> - Spreading apart will allow your team to each ink parts of the map <br>
        <strong> Occasionally flanking the enemies team in ranked games</strong>-  Since it's not about having the most turf, you can sneak behind the team and try to kill some of them <br>
        <strong> Saying booyah when getting 2 kills or more</strong>- Saying Boo-yah after getting 2 or more kills is just a fun thing to do; There's nothing special about it <br>
        <strong> Using different kinds of weapons</strong>- Using different kinds of weapons will give you more knowledge on what weapons to use instead of your main weapon you use <br>
        <strong> Use the new tactics in the game</strong>- The new moves in splatoon 3 are very versatile and can be used for many different things. It can easily turn a 1v1 around for the better <br>
    <strong> Play Salmon Run</strong>- Salmon Run is a great online  co-operative game mode to play for when you want to play as a team with other people instead going against them. It follows you and 3 other people to gather special eggs from the enemies called salmonoids. You go through 3 waves with each one getting harder and harder. There are special waves that can happen which can be based around 1 boss and there's only about 4 of these special waves. There's also a new final wave which is a huge boss and its name is the Cohozuna and the most efficient way to kill it is to throw eggs you gather from the regular bosses and throw it at it to deal large amounts of damage.</p>
	  <h1>What not to do:</h1>
	  <p><strong>Do not spam the communication button</strong>- Spamming the communication buttons is very annoying to your teammates unless they decide to do it with you <br>
        <strong> Not helping your teammates out</strong>- Whenever a teammate or teammates calls for help by saying "This way", they usually need help with pushing into the enemies team territory <br>
    <strong> Not participating in Splatfest</strong>- Splat-fest is a huge event that usually happens on the weekends and it's all about helping and rooting for your team. You will also gain rewards for being in splat-fest and winning it</p>
