	  <h1>How my gaming life started:</h1>
	  <p>It all started some years ago when it was my 4th birthday and I was just in my old house playing New Super Mario Bros Wii with my aunt. I was playing as Luigi at the time my aunt was Mario. After that I decided to play with my parents and from that time forward they knew that I was going to become a gamer from those years and after. I always played games throughout my life and pretty much my whole life due to it being calm and peaceful to play video games alone. There are also fun and cooperative multiplayer games that anyone can enjoy. I remember the first times I played multiplayer games with some family and it was chaotic. My mom is dying all the time, my dad hardly knowing how to play, and me carrying them to victory. I remember when I would be the last one alive to win the game for my whole family or my friends and everyone would be screaming ¨ YES MARCEL ¨ which is always a great feeling. Other times it would be something like ¨good try or you almost had it bro¨ which can sometimes put stress on you if it happens. I remember when I used to go to my grandmas house and play on all different types of consoles like the PS3, 3Ds, Wii, WiiU, Xbox360, and much more, but I mostly only played Mario related games throughout my gaming life. Nowadays, there are so many games in this world that most of them get boring pretty fast. The only certain type of games I find amusing are any fun cooperative games for a group of people. I prefer cooperative horror games because it is funny hearing your friends scream in terror while you are chilling in a different part of the game.</p>

      <p>The Mario franchise and its games are my all time favorites. Even though thee game may be repetitive, it is still a great game and I love every second of playing it.  I love to use the power-ups given to just rush through the level.  This is one of the best, if not the best franchise I have ever played
        . My favorite game is New Super Mario Bros Wii because it was one of those games where it never got old and was always fun and is better with friends and or family. </p>

      <p>The sonic franchise is one of my favorites too. I love how you can just run through loops, bash through some bots, and say stupid one-liners like ¨you're too slow!¨ There are so many cool characters like tails who can fly or shadow who can use the chaos emeralds to teleport and freeze time and if you get all the chaos emeralds you become a super version of the charcater you play like Super Sonic. </p>
