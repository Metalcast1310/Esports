    <p> <strong> Today's Prompt: 
		<br>describe your setting for gaming. During the 15 minutes, where were you located? What did it feel like? Practicing for the narrative story to come soon</strong></p>
	  <p>Answer: 
		  <br>My gaming setting is just the TV on the wall and my gaming chair is opposite of it, with my desk in front of my gaming chair. It is all located in my bedroom and it feels nice to have what you need.
		  <p><strong>Question: 
			  <br> Why that game? What makes it so fun to play?</strong></p>
	  <p>Answer: 
		  <br>I picked a rhythm game because it challenges your instincts and reaction to click the notes on beat. Itâ€™s so fun beating all the levels, showing your friends how fast it can go to beat it, and overall a fun game. It belongs to the music genre. This game is unique because it doesn't just pull songs from around the world, it also pulls in song from other video games.
		  <p><strong>Prompt</strong>: <br>
			  <strong>Why are video games and games in general so powerful a factor in society? </strong>
		  <p>Answer: 
			  <br>Video games/games in general are a powerful factor in society because it allows people to connect virtually without having them to show themselves.Video games can inspire people in different ways to make a video game themselves or just gives them something to do that they want.  It also allows for people to see what kind of game genre they all have in common. It almost shows their personality and who they are depending on the game too.
